        \firstquestion
        Determine the limits of the following sequences:
        
        \[
	        a_n := \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{2n}, \quad b_n := \left(\frac{n+8}{n+7} \right)^{n+4}, \quad c_n := \left(n + \frac{1}{n^2} \right)^{n}, \quad d_n := \left(1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n
        \]
        
        \question 
        Show: Each subsequence of a convergent sequence converges to the same limit. 
        
        \question 
        Show that for each sequence that is unbounded above / below has a subsequence that goes to $+ \infty / - \infty$. Conclude: Every sequence of real numbers has a finite or improper convergent subsequence. 
        
        \begin{inlinetoprove}
        	Each sequence that is unbounded above has a subsequence that goes to infinity.
        \end{inlinetoprove}
        \begin{proof}
        	Let $a_n$ be a random sequence unbounded above. Then it holds that:
        	\[
	        	\forall_{M > 0} \exists_{n \in \naturals} : a_n > M\,.
        	\]
	        Let $n_k$ be an index sequence. As any such sequence is strictly increasing and $n_k \xrightarrow{k\to\infty} \infty$ we have
	        \[
		        \forall_{M > 0} \exists_{k \in \naturals} : a_{n_{k}} > M\,.
	        \]
	        Now, let $a_{n_{k-1}} = M$. Then
	        \[
		        \exists_{k \in \naturals} : a_{n_{k}} > M = a_{n_{k-1}}\,.
	        \]
	        Take $a_{n_0} = a_0$ as a starting point. Now $a_{n_k}$ is a strictly increasing (sub)sequence that is unbounded above. Therefore it holds that:
	        \[
		        \forall_{M > 0} \exists_{k^* \in \naturals} \forall_{k \ge k^*} : a_{n_k} > M \implies a_{n_k} \xrightarrow{k \to \infty} \infty\,.
	        \]
	        We have now shown that each sequence that is unbounded above has a subsequence that goes to infinity.
        \end{proof}
        
        \begin{inlinetoprove}
        	Each sequence that is unbounded below has a subsequence that goes to $- \infty$.
        \end{inlinetoprove}
        \begin{proof}
        	Let $a_n$ be a random sequence unbounded below. Then it holds that:
        	\[
        	\forall_{M < 0} \exists_{n \in \naturals} : a_n < M
        	\]
        	Let $n_k$ be an index sequence. As any such sequence is strictly increasing and $n_k \xrightarrow{k\to\infty} \infty$ we have
        	\[
        	\forall_{M < 0} \exists_{k \in \naturals} : a_{n_{k}} < M
        	\]
        	Now, let $a_{n_{k-1}} = M$. Then
        	\[
        	\exists_{k \in \naturals} : a_{n_{k}} < M = a_{n_{k-1}}
        	\]
        	Take $a_{n_0} = a_0$ as a starting point. Now $a_{n_k}$ is a strictly decreasing (sub)sequence that is unbounded below. Therefore it holds that:
        	\[
        	\forall_{M > 0} \exists_{k^* \in \naturals} \forall_{k \ge k^*} : a_{n_k} < M \implies a_{n_k} \xrightarrow{k \to \infty} -\infty\,.
        	\]
        	We have now shown that each sequence that is unbounded above has a subsequence that goes to minus infinity.
        \end{proof}
        
        \begin{inlinetoprove}
        	Every sequence of real numbers has a finite or improper convergent subsequence. 
        \end{inlinetoprove}
        \begin{proof}
        	Every sequence $a_n$ falls under one of the following categories:
        	\begin{itemize}
        		\item $a_n$ bounded.
        		
	        	In this case, according to Bolzano-Weierstrass' theorem, the sequence $a_n$ has a subsequence $a_{n_k}$ converging to some finite number.
        	
        		\item $a_n$ is unbounded (above, below or both).
        		
		        In this case, we can use the fact that we have proven that if $a_n$ is unbounded above / below, then it has a subsequence that goes to $\infty / - \infty$. This sequence therefore has an improper convergent subsequence. 
        	\end{itemize}
        	In conclusion: in all cases, $a_n$ has a subsequence that converges or has an improper limit. 
        \end{proof}
        \question
        Find all accumulation points of the following sequences:
        \[
	        a_n := \frac{k}{dn}, \quad b_n := \left(-1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^n
        \]
        
        (Show that you have indeed found all accumulation points!)
        
        \question
        For a sequence $\{a_n \} $, define $V(\{a_n \})$ the set of accumulation points. Give examples of sequences $\{a_n \}$ such that:
        
        \begin{parts}
        	\part $V(\{a_n \})$ has exactly 4 elements 
        	\part $V(\{a_n \})$ has infinitely many elements
        	\part $\star$ $V(\{a_n \}) = [0, 1]$
        \end{parts}
