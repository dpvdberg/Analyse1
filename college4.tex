        \firstquestion
        Determine the limits of the following sequences:
        
        \[
	        a_n := \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{2n}, \quad b_n := \left(\frac{n+8}{n+7} \right)^{n+4}, \quad c_n := \left(n + \frac{1}{n^2} \right)^{n}, \quad d_n := \left(1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n
        \]
        
        \question 
        Show: Each subsequence of a convergent sequence converges to the same limit. 
        
        \question 
        Show: Each sequence that is unbounded above / below has a subsequence that goes to $+ \infty / - \infty$. Conclude: Every sequence of real numbers has a finite or improper convergent subsequence. 
        
        \question
        Find all accumulation points of the following sequences:
        \[
	        a_n := \frac{k}{dn}, \quad b_n := \left(-1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^n
        \]
        
        (Show that you have indeed found all accumulation points!)
        
        \question
        For a sequence $\{a_n \} $, define $V(\{a_n \})$ the set of accumulation points. Give examples of sequences $\{a_n \}$ such that:
        
        \begin{parts}
        	\part $V(\{a_n \})$ has exactly 4 elements 
        	\part $V(\{a_n \})$ has infinitely many elements
        	\part $\star$ $V(\{a_n \}) = [0, 1]$
        \end{parts}
